# Flight Controllers‚úàÔ∏è

## OverviewüëÄ
This project demonstrates a visual instrument panel built with React and CSS. It features:
- **Altitude Bar:** A gradient background revealed proportionally based on altitude.
- **Heading Indicator (HSI):** A compass-like circle with labels that rotate based on the provided heading value.
- **Attitude Indicator (ADI):** A circle whose color changes instantly based on an input value.

## Features‚ú®
- **Dynamic Altitude Bar:** Shows a gradient from green to red with a white overlay that reveals based on the altitude parameter.
- **Rotating Compass (HSI):** The labels (0, 90, 180, 270) rotate based on the value of the HSI parameter, so that the current heading is always at the top.
- **Color-Changing ADI:** transitions between green (land) and blue (sky) based on the input value, with a 50-50 split at ADI = 0.
